	<h1>Hello world! Is this working?</h1>
	<p>Hi, welcome to my blog. I am studying to be a computer vision scientist, and this is going to be a place where I share my study notes and some beginner tutorials.
    My primary language at work is C++, but I use Python for my computer vision and machine learning projects. Some of the libraries I use are
    PyTorch, Keras, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.</p>
	<p>I also have some interests in art and psychology, and there may be random posts about these subjects as well.</p>
	<p>By the way, I set up this site following <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this guide</a> written by Jonathan McGlone. It was very helpful and much appreciated. </p>
