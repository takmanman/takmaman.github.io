		<h1>Hello world! Is this working?</h1>
<p>Hi, welcome to my blog. It is hard to describe who I am as I have dabbled in many things, and yet I can't say I am an expert in any. </p>
<p>In the earlier times I was a researcher in system modelling, which is the study of building mathematical models for real world processes. 
It has remained my main passion. It is likely I will talk about this subject the most on this blog. 
I also enjoy making things pretty, therefore I do things like creating fonts, designing UI and making mobile apps. 
Hopefully I will have something interesting and nice to look at for whoever come across this blog. </p>

		  <p>In this tutorial, I am going to walk through the necessary steps of building a CNN model in PyTorch. I will also talk about what kernerls, filters and feature maps are.</p>
